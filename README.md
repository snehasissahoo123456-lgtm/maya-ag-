# Maya — Founder-Controlled AI Operator

Maya is being evolved from the existing web-based Action Engine cockpit into a cloud-coordinated and locally executable AI operator.

## Current repository
- Web cockpit: React/Lit/TypeScript frontend.
- Backend: Node.js, Express, WebSockets.
- AI provider integration: Gemini through a server-side adapter.
- Existing action engine, platform registry, watcher, and task UI are retained as the starting point.

## Current development status
The \`maya/foundation-architecture\` branch adds the target architecture, security baseline, implementation roadmap, Android runtime plan, and shared task lifecycle primitives with tests.

This is a foundation milestone, not a finished autonomous agent. The Android directory is currently documentation only; no APK is present. Existing task execution and platform health code still require implementation and security remediation before real device or account access.

## Run locally
Requirements: a supported Node.js runtime and dependencies installed from the repository lockfile.

\`\`\`bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
bun run dev
\`\`\`

Set \`GEMINI_API_KEY\` in a local, untracked environment file only if using Gemini. Never commit API keys or real OAuth secrets.

## Commands
\`\`\`bash
bun run lint
bun run test
bun run build
\`\`\`

## Release policy
A task is not complete because a model says it is complete. Maya must provide independently verifiable execution evidence. High-risk actions require explicit Founder approval. Cloud availability does not imply that Android can run arbitrary code continuously in the background.
